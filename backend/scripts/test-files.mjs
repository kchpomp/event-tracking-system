 * Splits the backend test files between the two runners.
 *
 * The split is by filename, not by a hand-maintained list: a list rots silently, because `bun test`
 * treats a path that no longer exists as a filter matching nothing rather than as an error. A test
 * that needs the database is named `*.integration.test.ts`; everything else runs without one.
 *
 * Throws if any test file in the backend matches neither runner - a suite that runs nowhere and
 * fails nothing is the failure mode this whole module exists to prevent.
