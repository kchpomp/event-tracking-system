/**
 * The one place a background job is declared.
 *
 * One of three ways to work off the request path, and the one for *recurring* work:
 *   - `background-tasks.ts` defers best-effort work inside a single API request. Losing it on a
 *     restart is acceptable.
 *   - `outbox/` queues durable one-off work in PostgreSQL. Losing it is not acceptable, so it is
 *     retried until it succeeds or gives up.
 *   - this file declares work that happens on a timer, whether or not anyone asked for it.
 *
 * A task type is never scheduled; one job here, `outbox:drain`, runs every type.
 *
 * **Keep every import in this file a type import.** Tooling outside the backend reads this list
 * without a database, and may run before `prisma:generate` has; a runtime import here would drag
 * the Prisma client and the env schema along. Reach for `runtime` inside a job body instead of
 * importing a service at the top. `scripts/repo-env.test.mjs` enforces this.
 *
 * Jobs say what to do; they never say when or where. Three processes run this same registry:
 *   - `cron.ts`      - one shot, triggered by a provider timer (DigitalOcean job, Yandex trigger, system cron)
 *   - `scheduler.ts` - a timer inside a long-running process, for a VPS or a cloud worker
 *   - `worker.ts`    - a loop, for work that must run more often than once a minute or in parallel
 *
 * Adding a job here makes it available to all three. See docs/BACKGROUND_JOBS.md.
