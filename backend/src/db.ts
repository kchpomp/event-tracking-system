/**
 * Runs `job` only if no other process is already running it.
 *
 * `croner` protects a job from overlapping itself inside one process; two copies of the process
 * are two independent protections, which is why the guard lives in the database. The lock is held
 * by the surrounding transaction, so it is released when the job finishes and when the process
 * dies - no stale lock survives a crash.
 *
 * **The lock is only as long as `timeoutMs`.** It is Prisma's interactive-transaction timeout, not
 * a Postgres setting - do not go looking at `statement_timeout`. If the job outruns it, Prisma
 * rolls the transaction back and the lock is released while the job is still working: another
 * process can then start the same job, and this one fails after its side effects have already
 * landed. Give `timeoutMs` real headroom over the slowest run, and make jobs that can approach it
 * idempotent. That failure arrives as `JobLockExpiredError` so callers can say what actually
 * happened instead of logging a generic error.
 *
 * The other cost is an open transaction - and therefore a held connection - for the whole run, on
 * top of the connection the job itself uses.
