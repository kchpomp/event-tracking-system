# Install Checklist

This file is the intake record for this repository. The installing agent fills it in during first-run setup and keeps it current afterwards.

**For the agent:** ask the questions below in the user's language, in product terms, and write the answers into this file as you go. Do not start feature work until everything through *First-version capabilities* and every conditional section activated by those answers is completed. Never ask the user anything under *Decided by the agent* - make those calls yourself and explain them in product terms.

**For the product owner:** this is the record of what was decided about your project. If something here is wrong, say so - the agent treats this file as the source of truth for what your product needs.

Answer cells hold `_unanswered_` until the question is asked, and `n/a` when the question cannot apply to this project. Answers are written in the product owner's language, but the section headings and the capability-ledger state words stay in English: other documents refer to them by those exact names. Keep every section heading, even when its rows are all `n/a`.

**When working on the template itself** (not installing it for a project), there is nothing to record: leave every answer cell at `_unanswered_` and every checkbox unchecked - those would otherwise ship to each future install. The capability ledger is the exception: it always describes the current branch, so keep it current when template work adds or removes a capability.

**Install status:** `not started`
<!-- Set to: not started | in progress | completed YYYY-MM-DD -->

---

## 1. Project identity

| Question | Answer |
| --- | --- |
| New project from this template, or work on the template itself? | _unanswered_ |
| Project name / slug | _unanswered_ |
| Your own GitHub repository URL, if you have one | _unanswered_ |

If no GitHub destination is chosen, the repository is left without `origin` and publishing stays unconfigured. The template remote is detached during setup unless this checkout is explicitly for improving the template.

## 2. Product

| Question | Answer |
| --- | --- |
| What product do you want to build first? | _unanswered_ |
| What is the first user journey that must work end to end? | _unanswered_ |

## 3. Active surfaces

Mark what is active now, and set the install status to `in progress` as soon as this section is answered. From then on, everything unmarked is deferred and must be left alone: no features, no setup, no test flows. While the status is still `not started` nothing has been decided yet, so unmarked boxes mean "not asked", not "forbidden".

- [ ] `backend` - API, database, auth
- [ ] `webapp` - browser screens behind sign-in (no SEO)
- [ ] `website` - public pages that must rank in search or preview when shared
- [ ] `mobile` - Expo app (lives on the `mobile` branch; switch branches before setup)

| Question | Answer |
| --- | --- |
| Why the unmarked surfaces are deferred, if it needs explaining | _unanswered_ |
| If `mobile` is active: are Expo/EAS builds, Expo Push, and Maestro E2E needed now, or left unconfigured until later? | _unanswered_ |

The split between `webapp` and `website` is the agent's call, not the user's; `README.md` explains how to route a feature between them.

## 4. First-version capabilities

Ask about product needs, not implementations. Mark what the first version actually needs, then fill the row below even when nothing was ticked, so a later session can tell "asked, and the answer was no" from "not asked yet".

- [ ] Accounts / sign-in
- [ ] Saved data that survives a restart
- [ ] File, image, or media uploads → also answer *Files, images, and media*
- [ ] Paid subscriptions or one-off payments → also answer *Payments*
- [ ] Admin tools or roles
- [ ] External integrations (which: _unanswered_)
- [ ] Real-time chat, presence, collaboration, or live updates

| Question | Answer |
| --- | --- |
| What the first version explicitly should NOT do (write "nothing ruled out" if that is the answer) | _unanswered_ |

## 5. Files, images, and media

This project ships private file storage with user avatars, so answer these for the files your product adds on top; otherwise mark the rows `n/a`. Keep the section either way - `docs/STORAGE.md` sends the agent here when uploads are added later.

| Question | Answer |
| --- | --- |
| What do users upload? | _unanswered_ |
| Public, private, shared with selected people, or mixed? | _unanswered_ |
| Who can upload, view, replace, and delete? | _unanswered_ |
| Maximum file size and allowed file types | _unanswered_ |
| Do images need thumbnails, resizing, format conversion, compression, cropping, or moderation? | _unanswered_ |
| How long do files live after the owning record is deleted? | _unanswered_ |
| Should filenames be visible to users, or opaque? | _unanswered_ |

## 6. Website data and freshness

Answer these when `website` is active; otherwise mark the rows `n/a`. Keep product choices here and
follow the implementation contract in `docs/WEB_SURFACES.md`.

| Question | Answer |
| --- | --- |
| Which public product or content data comes from the backend/database at website build time? | _unanswered_ |
| How soon after that data changes must the public website show the change? | _unanswered_ |
| Which changes require an automatic rebuild/redeploy rather than a manual release? | _unanswered_ |

The default is Astro SSG. Database-backed public data is fetched while building static output. If
published database changes must appear automatically, implement the documented `website:rebuild`
outbox path. SSR or request-time rendering is an exception recorded here only when the required
freshness or personalization cannot be met by rebuild/redeploy.

## 7. Payments

Answer these only when payments are active above; otherwise mark the rows `n/a`. Keep the section either way, and replace the `n/a` answers if payments are added later.

| Question | Answer |
| --- | --- |
| What exactly do users pay for? | _unanswered_ |
| Recurring subscription, one-off purchase, or both? | _unanswered_ |
| Does the public website need a local cart or offer selection before registration/sign-in? | _unanswered_ |
| Which active surfaces need payment: browser checkout, App Store / Google Play, native card entry, Apple Pay, or Google Pay? | _unanswered_ |
| What stops working when someone does not pay? | _unanswered_ |

Whatever this project ends up with, the ledger below is what states it. Read `docs/WEB_SURFACES.md`
before implementing any payment surface. Browser checkout is built in authenticated `webapp` plus
the backend; `website` may pass a local cart but never owns a second payment flow. The `mobile`
template line ships App Store and Google Play subscriptions as working code that is switched off,
and may independently add policy-compliant card, Apple Pay, or Google Pay flows when the product
needs them. Declining a shipped payment capability means deleting its code during setup and
recording it as `removed`. Payments are never half-present and are never reintroduced on a guess.

## 8. Deployment

| Question | Answer |
| --- | --- |
| Is deployment needed now, or local-only for the moment? | _unanswered_ |
| Where are your users, and must the data stay in Russia? | _unanswered_ |
| Hosting, picked by the agent from the answer above: DigitalOcean / Yandex Cloud / own server | _unanswered_ |
| Production domains / URLs, per surface (API, webapp, website, media/CDN) | _unanswered_ |
| Which surfaces are released first | _unanswered_ |

**Ask the audience question, not the provider question.** A product owner knows where their users
are and whether data must stay in Russia; they should not be asked to compare clouds. The agent
picks the hosting from that answer:

| Hosting | Chosen when | What the template gives you |
| --- | --- | --- |
| DigitalOcean | Default for an audience outside Russia. | `bun run deploy:do:specs` generates validated App Platform specs; managed PostgreSQL, static sites, CDN, scheduled jobs and workers are all covered. |
| Yandex Cloud | Users in Russia, or data must stay there. | Serverless Containers, Managed PostgreSQL, Object Storage, API Gateway. Provisioning follows `docs/YANDEX_CLOUD.md` step by step - there is no generator. |
| Own server | Full control wanted, no vendor lock-in, and someone is willing to run the machine. | The same Docker image plus the in-repo scheduler, with a short runbook in the "Own Server" section of `docs/DEPLOYMENT.md`. No generator: you own TLS, backups, updates, and monitoring. |

Pick exactly one and record it above. The other paths are not kept "just in case": their scripts,
spec templates, and docs are deleted during setup. Follow the "If You Chose Another Hosting" list in
the document for each path you did **not** pick - so a Yandex project runs the one in
`docs/DEPLOYMENT.md`, a DigitalOcean project the one in `docs/YANDEX_CLOUD.md`, and an own-server
project both. Local development never requires cloud credentials
regardless of the choice.

Deployment is often deferred at install time, which leaves these rows `_unanswered_`. When the user later asks to deploy, ask the unanswered questions then and write the answers back here before following `docs/DEPLOYMENT.md`.

## 9. Decided by the agent - do not ask the user

The user is a product owner, not an engineer. These are engineering decisions the agent owns, makes, and explains only in product terms:

- Which browser surface a feature belongs to (`website` for SEO/public, `webapp` for behind-login).
- Which email provider the recorded hosting implies: Yandex Cloud means Postbox, anything else means Resend. Ask where the users are, not which mail service the owner prefers.
- SSG plus build-time backend data and rebuild/redeploy for public product information unless a recorded freshness or personalization need requires runtime rendering.
- One browser checkout in authenticated `webapp`; `website` may hand off a local cart but never owns payment. Mobile payment UI stays native and separate.
- Monolithic backend; no microservices during setup.
- Docker Compose for local PostgreSQL on every OS; never a native install unless the user insists.
- Astro for `website`; Next.js only if Vercel-style ISR is a stated product requirement.
- DigitalOcean App Platform defaults, machine sizes, and static-site vs service choices.
- Which hosting the recorded audience implies: Russia means Yandex Cloud, elsewhere means DigitalOcean, and an explicit wish for full control means an own server. Explain the pick in product terms; never ask the owner to compare providers.
- Managed Redis-compatible Pub/Sub only when real-time needs to scale across instances.
- Test boundaries: E2E for important user journeys, integration for API/auth/persistence, unit for pure rules.
- Libraries, file layout, naming, refactors, and validation scope.

## 10. Capability ledger

What this project actually contains. The agent updates it whenever a capability is added or removed. Every row carries exactly one state:

- `included` - present and expected to work.
- `available` - partly there but not usable yet; the note says exactly what is still missing, which may be configuration, routes, or UI.
- `absent` - not part of this project. Build it only after the product owner asks.
- `removed` - deliberately deleted during setup. **Do not re-add it.** A leftover reference, migration, or doc mention is not a product requirement; ask the product owner first.

A capability with no row is `absent` by default. Add the row instead of assuming. The State column always holds one of the four states above - never `_unanswered_` or `n/a`.

| Capability | State | Note |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Auth (email + password) | included | Template baseline. |
| Admin roles | included | Roles and seeding in `backend`; admin UI in `webapp`. |
| Password reset email delivery | included | Two providers behind one port, Yandex Cloud Postbox and Resend, selected by `EMAIL_DELIVERY`. It defaults to `disabled`, so a fresh install sends nothing and queues nothing; `console` prints messages locally. Delivery is durable: a request queues a `task_outbox` row and the shipped scheduler drains it every minute. Production needs an account with a provider and a deployed runner. See `docs/EMAIL.md`. |
| File/media storage | included | Private uploads end to end, with user avatars as the worked example. Stores on local disk by default and on any S3-compatible bucket via `PRIVATE_STORAGE_*`, with no code change between them. See `docs/STORAGE.md`. |
| Static asset precompression | included | `bun run static:precompress` writes `.br` and `.gz` next to the text assets in `webapp/dist` and `website/dist`, using `node:zlib` and no dependency. Deliberately outside `build`: only a proxy you run yourself reads those files, so the own-server path enables `gzip_static`/`precompressed` and the other two compress at their CDN - DigitalOcean's automatically, Yandex Cloud CDN with `--gzip-on`. Each hosting document says which applies. |
| Website build-time backend data | absent | The baseline landing content is repository-owned; add a shared public DTO and build fetch only when `website` needs database-backed information. |
| Automatic SSG rebuild | absent | Durable desired/published revision state, single-flight deployment reconciliation, immutable atomic/blue-green release promotion, public-marker verification, and a provider adapter are not implemented. Yandex additionally needs a separate builder/upload component. See `docs/WEB_SURFACES.md`. |
| Website cart handoff | absent | No local cart or cross-origin handoff exists on the default branch. When activated, it feeds the one authenticated browser checkout defined in `docs/WEB_SURFACES.md`. |
| Browser checkout / payments | absent | No browser checkout or payment code exists. Build it in `webapp` plus the backend, never in `website`. Store subscriptions come from the mobile template line. |
| Push notifications | absent | No push code here. Expo Push comes from the mobile template line. |
| Social sign-in (Apple / Google) | absent | No social auth here. It comes from the mobile template line. |
| Real-time / WebSockets | absent | Requires an explicit product need. |
| Background jobs | included | Jobs live in `backend/src/jobs.ts` and include `auth:sessions:cleanup`, `uploads:pending:cleanup`, and `outbox:drain`. The shipped `schedules` in `backend/src/scheduler.ts` runs `outbox:drain` every minute, and `bun run dev` starts that process alongside the API. Deploying it is still a choice - a DigitalOcean worker component, a Yandex VM, or systemd - and nothing runs on a timer in production until you do. `auth:sessions:cleanup` needs a schedule of its own or stale sessions and expired reset tokens are never deleted. `workerLoops` stays empty. See `docs/BACKGROUND_JOBS.md`. |
| Durable task outbox | included | `task_outbox` in PostgreSQL with handlers in `backend/src/outbox/handlers.ts`, drained by `outbox:drain`. Ships with the password-reset emails as its only producers, and stays empty until something enqueues. Adding a task type is a code change, never a migration. |

## 11. Environment checks

Verified by the agent during setup, not asked.

- [ ] `docker compose version` and `docker info` succeed (needed for backend/API, uploads, or DB-backed validation)
- [ ] `git remote -v` inspected; template remote detached unless contributing to the template
- [ ] App-local `.env` files created from `.env.example`, with a locally generated `JWT_SECRET` (never committed)
- [ ] Smallest meaningful validation run for the active surfaces

## 12. After setup

- [ ] Durable answers above filled in, install status set to `completed YYYY-MM-DD`
- [ ] Validation scope recorded for this project (which suites run before a change is called done): _unanswered_
- [ ] Project renamed from the template identifiers (`web_app_demo`, `web-app-demo`, `vibecoding-template`), `bun.lock` regenerated
- [ ] Deferred-surface notes added to the READMEs of surfaces that are not active
- [ ] `Bootstrap-Only Instructions` blocks deleted from `AGENTS.md` and `CLAUDE.md`
- [ ] Local URLs, commands run, and anything the user must authorize manually reported back to the user

`README.md`, `AGENTS.md`, `CLAUDE.md`, and some `docs/` runbooks route agents into this file by section name, so renaming a heading breaks those pointers silently. Add rows and sections a project needs, and cross-reference sections by name rather than by number so renumbering stays harmless.
