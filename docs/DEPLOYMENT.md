# Deployment

Use this document only after the user has asked for deployment. Read [CHECKLIST.md](../CHECKLIST.md) first; it records the installed project's active surfaces, deferred surfaces, capabilities, and release targets. Surface READMEs carry the longer explanations behind those answers.

The default production path is DigitalOcean App Platform plus DigitalOcean Managed PostgreSQL. Do not ask the user to choose a cloud provider during first-run setup. Confirm the recorded release scope and production domains; when deployment was deferred at install time those rows are still `_unanswered_`, so ask for them now and write the answers back into the checklist. Then ask only the release details the checklist does not cover:

- which S3-compatible bucket backs private file storage in this release; the backend requires one in production, so this is a choice of provider rather than whether to have storage;
- whether real-time chat, presence, collaboration, live notifications, or WebSocket-style updates must work across multiple backend instances;
- whether an external CDN is required for advanced bot, rate-limit, or geographic traffic controls.

If mobile is active, switch to the `mobile` branch before mobile release planning.

Local setup from `README.md` and [LOCAL_DATABASE.md](LOCAL_DATABASE.md) does not require cloud credentials.

This document covers the DigitalOcean path. If `CHECKLIST.md` records Yandex Cloud, use [YANDEX_CLOUD.md](YANDEX_CLOUD.md) instead. The supported Yandex Cloud alternative is Serverless Containers for backend/API, Managed Service for PostgreSQL for production data, Object Storage for files and static websites, and Cloud CDN for public static/media delivery.

## If You Chose Another Hosting

The hosting choice is recorded in [CHECKLIST.md](../CHECKLIST.md) and only one path is kept. If the
project runs on Yandex Cloud or an own server, delete the DigitalOcean tooling in one pass.

**Delete these files**

- `scripts/deploy-do.mjs`, `scripts/deploy-do.test.mjs`, `scripts/do-cron.mjs`, and
  `scripts/do-cron.test.mjs` - the cron validator has no other reader, and leaving its test behind
  breaks `bun run test` on a module that is gone
- `.do/`

**Then make the one conditional file deletion**, which depends on the path you kept rather than on this
one. The static precompression tooling - `scripts/precompress-static.mjs`, its test, the
`static:precompress` script in root `package.json`, and its `README.md` bullet - is own-server
tooling, not DigitalOcean tooling:

- On the **own server** path keep all four and leave the `CHECKLIST.md` ledger row `included`, but
  rewrite that row's Note and the `README.md` bullet: both currently explain the capability by
  contrasting DigitalOcean and Yandex, and every trace of both providers is gone by the end of
  setup. Name the proxy you actually run instead.
- On the **Yandex** path delete all four: Cloud CDN compresses at the edge there, so the files have
  no reader and their tests would run for a path the project does not use. Then keep the
  `CHECKLIST.md` row rather than deleting it, set its State to `removed`, and rewrite its Note to
  say the tooling was deleted and why. A deleted row leaves the capability `absent`, which reads as
  "not built yet", and a Note still describing a working command invites the next agent to restore
  it. Delete the `README.md` bullet with the command. Both remaining mentions in this file - the
  "Own Server" bullet and the "CDN And Domains" paragraph - sit in sections the Yandex path deletes
  wholesale, so they need no separate edit.

**Edit these files** - one bullet each, so nothing is left half-removed:

- root `package.json`: drop the `deploy:do` script. Leaving it behind points at a deleted
  script - remove both together or neither.
- **this file**: delete every section except the seven below, then clean those seven.
  - "Release Source Preflight" - drop the App Platform paragraph.
  - "Secrets And Backend Env" - `TRUSTED_PROXY_CLIENT_IP_HEADER=do-connecting-ip` is wrong on any
    other ingress, `PRIVATE_STORAGE_ENDPOINT` names a DigitalOcean host, and the storage paragraph mentions
    `.do/api-app.yaml`, which no longer exists.
  - "Own Server" - keep as is; on the Yandex path, delete it too.
  - "Production Auth And CORS" - drop the sentence naming the two `.do/` specs; the same-site rule
    itself is a browser rule and stays.
  - "Real-Time And Horizontal Scaling" - keep the monolith-first and Pub/Sub guidance, drop the
    Managed Valkey provisioning.
  - "Validation" - keep the local checks and the post-deploy list, minus the two `deploy:do` lines.
  - "Mobile Releases" - keep as is.
  - Then rewrite the opening paragraphs above, which announce DigitalOcean as the default path.
- `docs/BACKGROUND_JOBS.md`: the DigitalOcean bullet under "Provider specifics", the App Platform
  half of the cadence sentence, and the two App Platform links. If the Yandex bullet is gone too, delete the
  now-empty "Provider specifics" heading.
- `docs/YANDEX_CLOUD.md`, when that is the chosen path: the opening sentence comparing the two
  providers, the Dockerfile line that says "the same as the DigitalOcean path", the storage
  paragraph's note that the service is named around the DigitalOcean default. One more, only
  because the conditional deletion above removed that command on this path: in the paragraph after
  the upload block, replace the first sentence - the one naming `bun run static:precompress` - with
  ``The `.br`/`.gz` exclusions are belt-and-braces: such files have no use in a bucket.`` The rest of
  that paragraph stays, including the warning against setting `Content-Encoding` by hand, which is
  about buckets and not about the deleted script, and so do the exclusion flags in the commands.
  Keep everything else, including "Two details of the timer trigger cost people time" -
  those are Yandex traps, not a comparison.
- `docs/STORAGE.md`: the DigitalOcean provider specifics. Keep the upload flow, the private/public
  rules, and the storage-service guidance - they are about S3 and about this codebase, not about
  DigitalOcean.
- `webapp/README.md` and the root `README.md`: the DigitalOcean deployment guidance and every
  `bun run deploy:do` mention, including the setup instructions near the top of `README.md`
  that name DigitalOcean as the supported production path.
- `backend/README.md`: the DigitalOcean part of "Deployment".
- `website/README.md`: the `.do/api-app.yaml.example` link and the
  `bun run deploy:do website` command.
- `docs/ARCHITECTURE.md`: the App Platform sizing and component guidance, the DigitalOcean half of
  the Valkey broker sentence, and the Managed Valkey link. Agents are told to read this file for
  non-trivial work, so a leftover here misdirects every future session.
- `AGENTS.md` and `CLAUDE.md`: the App Platform spec-defaults rule and the "anything else means
  DigitalOcean" half of the hosting rule. Keep the two files identical.
- `CHECKLIST.md`: the DigitalOcean row in the hosting table, the option in the recorded-hosting row,
  the DigitalOcean half of the hosting rule, and the App Platform defaults in the agent-owned
  decisions section. Storage stays: it is provider-neutral and every hosting path needs it.
- `backend/src/env.ts` and `backend/.env.example`: the `PRIVATE_STORAGE_*` values, if the project
  also moves object storage. The storage layer is provider-neutral, so this is a configuration
  change rather than a code change.

Finally, sweep for what no list can enumerate:

```bash
rg -n 'DigitalOcean|App Platform|deploy:do|doctl|Spaces|\.do/' --glob '!node_modules'
```

Every hit must either go or become provider-neutral, with three exceptions to leave alone:

- `backend/src/jobs.ts` - the one line that matches names all three hostings to explain what a
  job is, and is already provider-neutral;
- `website/astro.config.mjs` - a comment naming both providers next to the static output path;
- `backend/src/db.test.ts`, `backend/src/env.test.ts`, `backend/src/storage/*.test.ts` -
  "DigitalOcean" appears only in test titles about connection strings and S3 URL shapes.

Everything else goes. Keep the storage guidance that is really about S3 and uploads; only the
DigitalOcean specifics go.

When you are done, delete **both** "If You Chose Another Hosting" sections - this one, and the one
in the hosting document you kept. The choice is made; a surviving section tells the project to
delete the tooling it actually uses.

`bun run test:deploy` runs whatever is left in `scripts/`, so no test list needs editing. Run
`bun run typecheck` and `bun run test` afterwards to confirm.

## Release Source Preflight

Before any deployment or cloud-resource update, verify the release source:

```bash
git remote -v
git status --short --branch
```

Deploy only from the intended release branch after the intended commit is pushed and the local branch is in sync with its upstream. If the worktree has modified, deleted, or untracked files, stop and report that deployment is blocked. Do not run `git reset`, `git checkout --`, `git clean`, `git stash`, or equivalent cleanup to make deployment possible unless the user explicitly requested that exact destructive action.

DigitalOcean App Platform builds from the connected Git branch, not from local `dist` folders or uncommitted files. A dirty local checkout can still cause an agent to deploy the wrong branch, or to erase another session's work while trying to make the branch clean. The supported failure mode is to stop, not to repair the checkout.

## Secrets And Backend Env

Do not store secrets in the repository. Minimum backend production env:

```bash
DATABASE_URL=postgresql://...
JWT_SECRET=<64-or-more-hex-characters>
CORS_ORIGINS=https://webapp.example.com,https://website.example.com
ACCESS_TOKEN_TTL_SECONDS=900
REFRESH_TOKEN_TTL_DAYS=30
REFRESH_REUSE_GRACE_SECONDS=10
SESSION_ABSOLUTE_TTL_DAYS=90
SESSION_RETENTION_DAYS=7
AUTH_BODY_LIMIT_BYTES=65536
AUTH_RATE_LIMIT_MAX=60
AUTH_RATE_LIMIT_WINDOW_SECONDS=60
ADMIN_USERS_READ_RATE_LIMIT_MAX=120
ADMIN_USERS_READ_RATE_LIMIT_WINDOW_SECONDS=60
SHUTDOWN_GRACE_SECONDS=20
TRUST_PROXY=true
TRUSTED_PROXY_CLIENT_IP_HEADER=do-connecting-ip
COOKIE_SECURE=true
```

`CORS_ORIGINS` must include every browser origin that calls the API with credentials. Use exact origins only, for example `https://webapp.example.com`; do not use wildcards, empty values, or paths.

`JWT_SECRET` belongs in the production backend runtime env. Generate it with `openssl rand -hex 32`; that command creates 32 random bytes encoded as 64 hex characters. Do not use the placeholder from `backend/.env.example`, repeated characters, or human phrases.

`TRUSTED_PROXY_CLIENT_IP_HEADER` must name the header your ingress actually sets, otherwise auth rate limits and session metadata are scoped to the ingress instead of the client. DigitalOcean App Platform puts the real client address in `do-connecting-ip` and uses `X-Forwarded-For` for the ingress server itself, so keep `do-connecting-ip` on this path. Behind Yandex Serverless Containers or your own reverse proxy the value is `x-forwarded-for`; change it together with the hosting, and set `TRUST_PROXY=false` if nothing trustworthy sits in front of the backend.

`AUTH_RATE_LIMIT_*` and `ADMIN_USERS_READ_RATE_LIMIT_*` use bounded in-process maps. The admin directory budget is shared by all sessions and search filters for the same administrator, but neither budget is global across multiple backend processes. Replace the in-memory store with shared state before scaling the API to multiple instances when global enforcement is required.

Object storage is required, not optional: the image runs with `NODE_ENV=production`, where the backend refuses the filesystem storage driver because a container disk does not survive a redeploy. A backend deployed without this group crash-loops on its first boot.

```bash
PRIVATE_STORAGE_DRIVER=s3
PRIVATE_STORAGE_REGION=nyc3
PRIVATE_STORAGE_BUCKET=<project-prod>
PRIVATE_STORAGE_ENDPOINT=https://nyc3.digitaloceanspaces.com
PRIVATE_STORAGE_ACCESS_KEY_ID=<storage-access-key>
PRIVATE_STORAGE_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY=<storage-secret-key>
PRIVATE_STORAGE_ALLOW_REMOTE_ENDPOINT=true
PRIVATE_STORAGE_FORCE_PATH_STYLE=false
PRIVATE_STORAGE_UPLOAD_MAX_BYTES=5242880
PRIVATE_STORAGE_UPLOAD_URL_TTL_SECONDS=900
PRIVATE_STORAGE_DOWNLOAD_URL_TTL_SECONDS=300
```

On DigitalOcean the non-secret half of the group is in `.do/api-app.yaml` and the two access credentials are `SECRET` entries set in the console; copy the whole group into any worker or cron component you add. On another hosting, set the same variables on every backend runtime by hand.

## Own Server

Chosen when the project wants full control and no vendor lock-in. There is no generator and no
managed platform here: every step below is yours to run and to keep running.

- **Backend.** Build `backend/Dockerfile` from the repository root and run it with the env group
  from "Secrets And Backend Env". Behind a reverse proxy set `TRUST_PROXY=true` and
  `TRUSTED_PROXY_CLIENT_IP_HEADER=x-forwarded-for`; with the container exposed directly, set
  `TRUST_PROXY=false`.
- **Database.** PostgreSQL 18 or newer, because primary keys use `uuidv7()`. Apply migrations with
  `bun run --cwd backend db:deploy` as a step before the new container starts serving, never with
  `prisma migrate dev`. Take backups yourself and restore-test them; nobody else will.
- **TLS and domains.** Terminate TLS at the proxy (Caddy or nginx with certbot) and keep the API
  and the browser app under one registrable domain, as "Production Auth And CORS" requires.
- **Static surfaces.** `bun run build:webapp` and `bun run build:website` produce plain directories;
  serve them from the same proxy with `index.html` as the SPA catch-all for the webapp. Then run
  `bun run static:precompress`, which writes `.br` and `.gz` next to the text assets. This is the
  one hosting path that reads those files, and it is worth the step: brotli at maximum quality
  costs nothing per request because it already ran at build time, and it takes the largest asset in
  `website/dist` from 885 KB to 192 KB. In Caddy, add `precompressed br gzip` inside the
  `file_server` block - written on its own line, because a Caddyfile wants the opening brace last
  on its line and the closing brace alone on its own. In nginx it is one line:
  `gzip_static on; gzip_vary on; gzip_proxied any;`. Both only ever send a variant to a
  client whose `Accept-Encoding` asked for it, and neither compresses anything itself, so an image
  or a font is served untouched. Three nginx details that Caddy handles for you, each a default
  that can make the feature do nothing or do harm without saying so:
  - `gzip_vary` is `off`, so nginx sends an encoding-dependent response with no
    `Vary: Accept-Encoding`, and any shared cache in front can hand the gzip copy to a client that
    never asked and cannot decode it.
  - `gzip_proxied` is `off`, which disables compression for every proxied request, and `gzip_static`
    honours it. nginx calls a request proxied when it carries a `Via` header, so this costs nothing
    while nginx faces the internet directly and silently disables the whole precompress step the
    day anything is put in front of it - a CDN, a cache, another nginx.
  - Neither `gzip_static` nor `brotli_static` is in a default nginx build, though the two directives
    above are. `gzip_static` needs `--with-http_gzip_static_module`, which every distro, nginx.org
    and Homebrew package already sets - but a source build does not, and nginx refuses to start on
    a directive it does not know.
    `brotli_static` is further out: it is not nginx's at all, but the third-party `ngx_brotli`
    module. Without it nginx ignores the `.br` files and serves gzip, which is still most of the
    win, so treat brotli on nginx as optional and gzip as the thing to verify first.
- **Background jobs.** Run `bun run --cwd backend start:scheduler` as its own service - see
  [BACKGROUND_JOBS.md](BACKGROUND_JOBS.md) for the systemd and Docker recipes.
- **Uploads.** `backend/src/storage` speaks S3 through a provider-neutral port, so any S3-compatible object storage
  works; see [STORAGE.md](STORAGE.md).

Alert on the backend health endpoint and on "the scheduled job has not reported success recently".
A managed platform surfaces a crash loop for you; here, silence looks exactly like success.

## DigitalOcean App Platform

Prerequisites:

1. DigitalOcean account with billing enabled.
2. A project and region chosen close to the expected users.
3. `doctl` installed and authenticated:

```bash
doctl auth init
```

4. DigitalOcean App Platform GitHub integration connected in the DigitalOcean Dashboard, with access to the user's repository before `doctl apps create`. Without this, `doctl apps create` can fail with `GitHub user not authenticated`.
5. DigitalOcean Managed PostgreSQL for production. Do not use App Platform dev databases for production data.
6. DigitalOcean Spaces Standard Storage, or another S3-compatible bucket, for private file storage. The backend refuses the filesystem storage driver in production, so a deployed app always needs one.
7. DigitalOcean Managed Valkey only when horizontally scaled real-time features need Pub/Sub between backend instances.
8. Production domains and DNS access for the authenticated webapp and API. Browser auth requires both custom hosts under one registrable site, for example `app.example.com` and `api.example.com`.

Prefer an App Platform app spec so the backend service, static sites, env, domains, and database attachment stay reviewable. The specs are committed in `.do/` and applied one surface at a time by `bun run deploy:do`.

Consult the current App Spec docs before applying a spec, because provider fields and limits change.

## Safe DigitalOcean App Spec Workflow

The spec is the shape of the deployment. The DigitalOcean console is where secret values live.

Copy the templates the install needs, fill in the identifiers marked `REPLACE_WITH_*`, and commit them:

```bash
cp .do/api-app.yaml.example .do/api-app.yaml
cp .do/webapp-app.yaml.example .do/webapp-app.yaml
cp .do/website-app.yaml.example .do/website-app.yaml
```

Then deploy a surface:

```bash
export DO_EXPECTED_TEAM='<the DigitalOcean team that owns the app>'
bun run deploy:do api        # or: webapp, website
```

Every env entry that declares a `key` and no `value` - including a bare `value:`, which YAML reads as null - is filled from the running app immediately before the update. `JWT_SECRET`, the `PRIVATE_STORAGE_*` credentials, and the `EMAIL_*` credentials are therefore set once in the DigitalOcean console and never pass through this repository, a shell history, or a file on disk. `--dry-run` reports what would change without touching the app. It runs every check except the release-source one, so that a spec can be validated while it is still being edited; a green dry run does not promise the real deploy will start on a dirty or unpushed checkout.

The spec is the **whole** environment, not a set of overrides. A variable added in the console but absent from the spec is removed on the next deploy, so add the key to the spec first and then set its value. The values are read from the app's current spec rather than its last successful deployment: a console edit whose deployment failed is still the operator's intent, and carrying the older one back would silently undo it.

The command refuses to deploy when:

- the spec still contains a `REPLACE_WITH_*` placeholder, or an env entry whose value is an empty string, which reads as configured but is not;
- `CORS_ORIGINS` uses a wildcard, a plaintext origin, or an origin with a path;
- a `SCHEDULED` component runs a task that is not in [../backend/src/jobs.ts](../backend/src/jobs.ts), or a cadence under App Platform's 15-minute floor;
- the running app has a component the spec no longer declares, since applying it would delete that component and every secret on it. Pass `--allow-remove` when that is the intent;
- the app exists but none of the spec's components came back from `doctl apps get`, which means the read did not return what was expected and every secret would deploy empty;
- either side uses the app-level `envs` block. This script works per component, so an app-level variable would be dropped with no line of output. Put those variables on the components that need them;
- the checkout is not the branch the spec deploys, the branch is not pushed and in sync, or the worktree has uncommitted or untracked changes;
- `DO_EXPECTED_TEAM` is unset, or does not match the team the current `doctl` token is scoped to. The first run prints the exact value to export.

Adding a component is reported rather than refused - a new worker legitimately starts with its secrets unset - but the report names it, because an addition and a rename look identical from the spec alone and a rename deletes the old component. A variable the running app has and the spec does not is reported the same way: the spec is authoritative, so applying it removes that variable, and the report is what turns a silent loss into a visible one.

It deliberately does not re-check `JWT_SECRET` strength, the storage driver, or the storage endpoint. Those are enforced where they are used: [../backend/src/env.ts](../backend/src/env.ts) refuses to boot on a weak or placeholder secret, on the filesystem driver under `NODE_ENV=production`, or on a remote endpoint that was never explicitly opened. A spec that gets them wrong fails at the first container start rather than silently.

### The First Deploy

There is no running app to copy secret values from yet, so the first deploy of the API takes three steps:

```bash
# 1. Create the app. Secret values arrive empty, so its first deployment fails at the
#    migrate job. That is expected: db:deploy refuses to finish without an administrator.
export DO_PROJECT_ID=<project id>       # places a newly created app; not needed later
bun run deploy:do api

# 2. In the DigitalOcean console, set the API secrets - JWT_SECRET from `openssl rand -hex 32`,
#    the PRIVATE_STORAGE_* credentials, the EMAIL_* credentials if this install sends email -
#    and set ADMIN_SEED_EMAIL and ADMIN_SEED_PASSWORD on the migrate job.

# 3. Deploy again. Every deploy from here on carries those values forward on its own.
bun run deploy:do api
```

Then delete `ADMIN_SEED_EMAIL` and `ADMIN_SEED_PASSWORD` from the migrate job in the console. They are needed exactly once; a later run would unlock and reset that administrator again. Everything else stays.

From then on every deploy prints one line naming those two keys as having no value and deploying empty. That is the correct steady state, not a problem to fix - the report states what is true rather than telling you to restore them. Do not tune it out, though: it shares a channel with the report that a variable set in the console is about to be deleted, which is the one worth reading.

Attach `api.example.com` to the API app and wait for DNS and TLS before deploying the webapp: `VITE_API_URL` is baked into the bundle at build time, so the API host must be final first.

```bash
bun run deploy:do webapp
bun run deploy:do website
```

Static Sites build from the connected Git branch, not from local `dist` folders. The branch must contain the full web/backend monorepo: root `package.json`, `bun.lock`, `backend`, `webapp`, `website`, and `packages/contracts`.

## Backend API

The backend runs as an App Platform web service. Keep the Docker build context at the repository root because [../backend/Dockerfile](../backend/Dockerfile) copies workspace manifests and `packages/contracts`.

Supported build paths:

- Repository build: App Platform service uses `dockerfile_path: backend/Dockerfile` with repository-root build context.
- Container image: build and push to DOCR, then point the App Platform service at that image.

DOCR image workflow:

```bash
docker build -f backend/Dockerfile -t registry.digitalocean.com/<registry>/<project>-backend:latest .
doctl registry login
docker push registry.digitalocean.com/<registry>/<project>-backend:latest
```

Backend service requirements:

- Set both the service `http_port` and `PORT` env to `8080` unless the project has a reason to choose another port.
- Use `instance_size_slug: apps-s-1vcpu-1gb` and `instance_count: 1` as the default production API starter shape. This is one shared 1 vCPU / 1 GiB App Platform container; verify current provider pricing before deployment.
- Configure readiness at `/health/ready` and liveness at `/health/live`.
- Set `COOKIE_SECURE=true` for HTTPS production traffic.
- Set `CORS_ORIGINS` to the exact deployed browser origins. Do not use `*`, empty values, or URLs with paths.
- Attach DigitalOcean Managed PostgreSQL or provide its connection string as `DATABASE_URL`.
- Set the complete `PRIVATE_STORAGE_*` group. It is required, not conditional: a backend deployed without a bucket crash-loops on startup.
- Keep the built-in limiter only for the default single-instance API. Use a shared limiter or trusted edge/WAF policy before increasing `instance_count`.

The default one-container shape is not a high-availability floor; it is the budget starter. Raise `instance_count` to two or three when availability or traffic justifies the extra monthly cost. Use `apps-s-1vcpu-2gb` or larger shared containers when memory pressure is the primary limit. Move to dedicated CPU only after metrics show CPU-bound work, noisy shared-CPU performance, strict latency requirements, or a need for CPU-based autoscaling. `webapp` and fully prerendered `website` output are Static Site components and do not have App Platform runtime container sizes. A `website` route with SSR/on-demand rendering or server islands needs a runtime service.

The committed App Platform `migrate` PRE_DEPLOY job runs:

```bash
bun run db:deploy
```

That command applies existing Prisma migrations, bootstraps or unlocks the first
administrator when the job has seed credentials, and then requires at least one
`admin` with a password credential. Once `ADMIN_SEED_EMAIL` and
`ADMIN_SEED_PASSWORD` are removed from the console after the first deploy, later
runs receive no bootstrap credentials and therefore never reset that password,
but still block a release if no login-capable administrator remains. Do not run
`prisma migrate dev` in production and do not hand-write migration SQL.

## Backend Worker And Cron

Jobs themselves are provider-neutral and documented in [BACKGROUND_JOBS.md](BACKGROUND_JOBS.md):
they are declared once in `backend/src/jobs.ts` and run by whichever process fits. This section
covers only the DigitalOcean side of that choice.

The backend ships as one Docker image with separate entrypoints:

- API service: `bun run start:api`
- one-shot job runner for a scheduled component: `bun run start:cron -- <job>`
- in-repo scheduler, if you would rather keep schedules in the repository than in App Platform:
  `bun run start:scheduler` as the worker component's run command
- loop worker, for work that must run more often than once a minute or continuously:
  `bun run start:worker`. Between one and fifteen minutes, use the scheduler instead - App
  Platform's own minimum cadence is 15 minutes, but a loop is the wrong shape for that gap

Keep API, worker, and cron in the same backend workspace so they share Prisma schema, generated Prisma client, env validation, contracts, and feature services. Do not create a second backend package or repository just to run background code.

DigitalOcean App Platform supports non-routable worker components and scheduled job components in the same app spec. `.do/api-app.yaml` always carries the API service and the `migrate` pre-deploy job; a worker or a scheduled job is a block you add to that file, and [../.do/api-app.yaml.example](../.do/api-app.yaml.example) ships both commented out with the shape to copy.

Give any component you add the same `DATABASE_URL` binding, `PRIVATE_STORAGE_*` group and `EMAIL_*` group as the API. None of that is conditional on what the job does: every runner builds storage and delivery through `createBackendRuntime`, so a worker or cron container without them fails the same startup validation the API would. An `EMAIL_*` group on the API alone is the worst version - the install accepts every password-reset request and delivers none of them, because the API is not the process that sends.

Use a worker component only after the process it runs has work to do. `schedules` ships with the outbox drain, so `bun run start:scheduler` is deployable as-is; `workerLoops` ships empty, so give it a loop before pointing a worker at `bun run start:worker`, or that process exits immediately and App Platform restarts it forever.

Production auth should schedule `auth:sessions:cleanup`. It removes revoked sessions and sessions past either sliding or absolute lifetime once `SESSION_RETENTION_DAYS` has passed, and removes expired password-reset tokens. `bun run deploy:do api` checks the task name in a scheduled component against `backend/src/jobs.ts`, so a typo is refused before it becomes a job that fails on every tick.

Every App Platform schedule must stay at or above its 15-minute floor, and that floor decides how the task outbox runs here. A password-reset email arriving fifteen minutes after the user asked for it is not acceptable, so an install that wires an email provider runs `outbox:drain` from the **worker** component with `bun run start:scheduler` and the one-minute entry in `backend/src/scheduler.ts` - not from a scheduled job. An install with no provider can leave the drain on a slow schedule or not run it at all: nothing is queued while delivery is unconfigured. See [BACKGROUND_JOBS.md](BACKGROUND_JOBS.md), "Running the drain", and [EMAIL.md](EMAIL.md) for the provider groups and the failure contract.

## Real-Time And Horizontal Scaling

Keep production architecture monolithic by default: one backend service can own HTTP routes, auth, persistence, and any WebSocket endpoints. Do not split chat, notifications, or presence into separate services unless there is a proven operational need.

When the backend runs as a single instance, WebSocket connection state can stay in that process. When App Platform is scaled to multiple containers, clients may connect to different backend instances. Any feature that must deliver the same event across those instances, such as chat messages, presence changes, or live notifications, needs a shared Pub/Sub broker.

Use DigitalOcean Managed Valkey as the default Redis-compatible broker for cross-instance fanout. Each backend instance publishes domain events to Valkey and subscribes to the channels it needs to deliver events to its local WebSocket connections. Do not add Valkey for ordinary request/response APIs, static pages, or single-instance development.

Valkey is a transient delivery layer, not the source of truth. Persist durable state in PostgreSQL first, publish small event messages after the write commits, and have each backend instance fan out only to its own local WebSocket or SSE clients. Clients should reconnect and refetch from the API because Pub/Sub messages can be missed during deploys, restarts, or network interruptions.

When a real-time feature needs cross-instance delivery, create a DigitalOcean Managed Valkey cluster in the same region as the app and database, attach the connection string to the backend as a runtime secret such as `VALKEY_URL`, and keep it out of static-site build-time env. Do not enable Valkey in the baseline template until the product has a realtime feature that requires it.

## Webapp Static Site

Deploy `webapp` as an App Platform Static Site component.

The minimum sufficient frontend tier is Static Site only. The CSR webapp lives behind auth and needs no SEO, so it stays a Static Site; do not add `instance_size_slug`, `instance_count`, or a service/container component for it.

Required component shape:

- Source directory/build context: repository root.
- Build command: `bun install --frozen-lockfile && bun run build:webapp`.
- Output directory: `webapp/dist`.
- Build-time env: `VITE_API_URL=https://api.example.com`.
- Index document: `index.html`.
- Catch-all document: `index.html`, because the React app uses client-side routing.

App Platform Static Sites are served through DigitalOcean's global CDN by default. Do not disable the CDN cache unless the product needs a specific behavior that the built-in CDN cannot provide.

`VITE_API_URL` is embedded at build time. If it is empty, the browser app can call its own static-site origin at `/api/*` instead of the backend. After changing `VITE_API_URL`, redeploy the static site; runtime env changes alone do not rewrite the already built bundle.

## Website Static Site

Deploy `website` as an App Platform Static Site component while it has only fully prerendered output and no server islands or runtime-rendered routes.

Read [WEB_SURFACES.md](WEB_SURFACES.md) before adding build-time backend data, an automatic rebuild,
or commerce handoff. This section owns provider deployment mechanics, not product-surface ownership.

The minimum sufficient website tier is Static Site only. This is still the default for the public SEO catalog of a marketplace. Use rebuild/redeploy for durable listing/category/content changes, and do not move the full authenticated app into Astro just because the product has public SEO pages. Keep `webapp` for buyer account, seller/admin, checkout/account, dashboard, and other non-indexed workflows.

Move only request-specific `website` routes to SSR/hybrid with `export const prerender = false`; those routes need the Node adapter at runtime and must be deployed as an App Platform **service** (a runtime container, like the backend) instead of a Static Site. Astro server islands also need an adapter and runtime service even when the surrounding page is prerendered. When server islands appear on cached pages or rolling deploys, generate a stable key with `astro create-key` and configure `ASTRO_KEY` as a secret in both build and runtime environments. Never commit it, expose it as `PUBLIC_*`, print it in logs, or bake it into static output. Per-page incremental static regeneration (ISR) is a Vercel/Netlify-style platform feature and is not available on App Platform Static Sites, so keep runtime pages fresh with CDN cache headers (`Cache-Control`, `stale-while-revalidate`) instead.

Use shared CDN caching only for anonymous, public-equivalent website responses. Auth-dependent or personalized routes and server islands must use `private` or `no-store`, or a deliberately supported `Vary: Cookie`/`Authorization` strategy. `ASTRO_KEY` protects server-island prop encryption across builds; it does not make personalized responses safe for shared caches.

Required component shape (static build):

- Source directory/build context: repository root.
- Build command: `bun install --frozen-lockfile && bun run build:website`.
- Output directory: `website/dist`.
- Index document: `index.html`.
- Required build-time canonical origin: `PUBLIC_WEBSITE_URL=${_self.PUBLIC_URL}` in the generated App Platform spec, or the concrete public origin on another provider.
- Optional build-time public config only when the website intentionally needs it, such as `PUBLIC_WEBAPP_URL=https://webapp.example.com`.

Keep website independent from authenticated browser-app flows unless the product explicitly needs shared API data. The baseline website spec therefore does not require `PUBLIC_WEBAPP_URL`; add it as explicit build-time public config only when the product actually links to a separate webapp, then redeploy website after it changes.

## Managed PostgreSQL

Use DigitalOcean Managed PostgreSQL **18** for production data. Do not accept a provider default implicitly: the committed schema uses native `uuidv7()`, which requires PostgreSQL 18+, and the generated App Spec pins `version: "18"`. For a new low-cost production launch, start with the smallest supported shared-CPU single-node plan and verify current provider pricing before deployment. When attaching the database inside App Platform, prefer bindable variables such as the database component's `DATABASE_URL`/`DATABASE_PRIVATE_URL` rather than copying raw credentials into the spec.

Operational defaults:

- Keep the database in the same region/VPC as the backend service when possible.
- Enable trusted sources for the App Platform app when using managed database network restrictions.
- Use a connection pool if the app starts hitting connection limits.
- Take backups before destructive schema or data operations.

DigitalOcean Managed PostgreSQL uses TLS. The backend normalizes `sslmode=require` database URLs by adding `uselibpqcompat=true` for the Prisma PostgreSQL adapter unless the URL already sets that option explicitly.

## Production Auth And CORS

Production browser auth may be cross-origin, but it must remain same-site: use custom hosts under one registrable domain, such as `app.example.com` and `api.example.com`. Independent App Platform default hosts such as `app-abc.ondigitalocean.app` and `api-xyz.ondigitalocean.app` are different browser sites because `ondigitalocean.app` is a public suffix. A `SameSite=None` cookie can still be blocked by browser third-party-cookie policy, so default ingress hosts are supported only for initial provisioning and non-cookie health checks, not production browser auth.

Both hosts must sit under one registrable site (`example.com` in the example). Nothing checks this for you on any hosting: verify that the `domains` entry in `.do/api-app.yaml`, the one in `.do/webapp-app.yaml`, and every origin in `CORS_ORIGINS` share the same registrable domain before the first deploy. Independent default hosts are the trap, because `ondigitalocean.app` is a public suffix and two apps under it are two different browser sites. The required runtime shape is:

- backend cookies: `HttpOnly`, `Secure`, `SameSite=None`, scoped to `/api/auth`;
- backend CORS: exact HTTPS origins only, `credentials: true`, no wildcard fallback;
- every cookie-based auth write (`register`, `login`, `refresh`, and `logout`): requires an `Origin` header that exactly matches `CORS_ORIGINS`;
- webapp API client: `credentials: include`;
- webapp static build: concrete `VITE_API_URL` pointing at the backend origin.

The backend env validator rejects empty/wildcard/path-bearing `CORS_ORIGINS`, requires HTTPS origins and secure cookies in production, and requires a generated hexadecimal `JWT_SECRET` in production.

## Object Storage

Use DigitalOcean Spaces Standard Storage, or any other S3-compatible bucket, for private file storage. Do not write uploads to the App Platform container filesystem; it is not durable across deployments or container replacements, which is why the backend refuses the filesystem storage driver in production.

Default production setup:

- Create the bucket in the same region group as the backend when practical, and keep it private.
- Configure its CORS rule for browser direct uploads from the deployed web origins, allowing `GET`/`PUT`/`HEAD` with the `Content-Type` and `If-None-Match` headers and exposing `ETag`. `browserUploadAllowedHeaders` in `backend/src/storage/config.ts` is the list the app itself uses.
- Set the complete `PRIVATE_STORAGE_*` group, including `PRIVATE_STORAGE_ALLOW_REMOTE_ENDPOINT=true`, which is the deliberate gate that lets the backend talk to a remote bucket at all.
- Objects are reached only through short-lived presigned URLs. This template has no public-object path: no public ACLs, no CDN base URL, no public URL builder. Adding one is a deliberate second surface — see [STORAGE.md](STORAGE.md).
- Generate optimized image variants in the backend, a worker, or a dedicated App Platform service when the product needs thumbnails, responsive sizes, compression, or format conversion.

DigitalOcean Spaces and Spaces CDN do not provide first-party dynamic image transformation. Add third-party image services only when the user explicitly chooses that product tradeoff.

## CDN And Domains

For `webapp` and fully prerendered `website` output, App Platform Static Sites already use DigitalOcean's global CDN. This is the default path.

Response compression belongs to that CDN, not to this repository. App Platform ingress rules can rewrite paths, but only as static path rules, and the only response headers a Static Site exposes are CORS - nothing can branch on `Accept-Encoding`. So a Static Site cannot pick a `.br` or `.gz` sibling for a request, and precompressed files placed in `output_dir` would be published and never served. Do not run `bun run static:precompress` on this path, and do not add it to `build`; confirm the CDN is compressing with the check in "Validation" instead. If a text asset comes back uncompressed, that is a question for DigitalOcean support, not a gap this repository can close.

Use an external CDN only for explicit advanced needs such as custom WAF rules, bot filtering, custom rate limiting, or geographic traffic controls. If an external CDN is used in front of App Platform:

- configure the custom domain on the CDN, not in App Platform;
- point the CDN origin to the default App Platform ingress, for example `<app-name>.ondigitalocean.app`;
- use HTTPS on port `443`;
- do not forward the original custom-domain `Host` header to App Platform.

## Mobile Releases

The default branch does not contain the runnable Expo app. Mobile release work, including Expo/EAS env, development builds, production builds, and App Store / Google Play guidance, lives on the `mobile` branch.

## Validation

Before changing cloud resources, run the smallest relevant local checks for the active surfaces:

```bash
bun run typecheck
bun run test
bun run build
```

For narrow deployment-only documentation or App Platform config work, run the subset that matches the affected surfaces, for example `bun run deploy:do api --dry-run`, `bun run build:webapp`, `bun run build:website`, or `bun run --cwd backend smoke:docker`.

After deployment:

- verify `bun run deploy:do <target> --dry-run` passes for every surface before the real deploy;
- verify `/health/live` and `/health/ready` on the backend public URL;
- verify browser auth only from allowed `CORS_ORIGINS`;
- verify `webapp` route refreshes hit the React catch-all instead of a static 404;
- verify `website` loads static assets from the deployed domain;
- verify text assets arrive compressed - `curl -sI -H 'Accept-Encoding: br, gzip' <origin>/<hashed-asset>` must answer with a `content-encoding` header, and the same request without `Accept-Encoding` must not. Take the asset path from the built output of the surface under test: `webapp` hashes into `assets/`, `website` into `_astro/`. Pick one of the large bundles: whatever compresses on the chosen hosting has a size floor below which a variant costs more than it saves, so the smallest assets come back uncompressed on a perfectly configured setup and testing one reports a failure that is not one. Whoever compresses on the chosen hosting, this is the check that proves it reached the browser;
- verify an avatar upload completes end to end against the production bucket, and that its download link expires and requires backend authorization;
- verify Prisma migrations were applied exactly once to the production database.
- verify the PRE_DEPLOY log confirms a login-capable administrator without printing bootstrap credentials.

## Failure Modes This Template Guards Against

- `GitHub user not authenticated`: App Platform GitHub integration was not connected or did not have repository access before `doctl apps create`.
- Empty secrets or URLs in a spec: `CORS_ORIGINS` and `VITE_API_URL` must be concrete before deployment, and an env entry with an empty-string value is refused because it reads as configured but is not.
- Secrets in the repository: no spec carries a secret value. An entry with a key and no value is filled from the running app at deploy time, so credentials live only in the DigitalOcean console.
- Dirty or ambiguous release source: deployment stops when the worktree has uncommitted or untracked files, the checkout is not the branch the spec deploys, or the branch is not pushed and in sync.
- Deploying into the wrong DigitalOcean team: `DO_EXPECTED_TEAM` must match the team the current `doctl` token is scoped to.
- Backend crash on startup: production requires a 64-or-more-character hexadecimal `JWT_SECRET`, which `backend/src/env.ts` enforces at boot, so an unsafe value fails the deployment instead of serving traffic.
- Broken browser auth CORS: production CORS must use exact HTTPS origins, not wildcard or empty values.
- Webapp calling its own `/api/*`: missing `VITE_API_URL` at static build time makes the bundle use the wrong origin.
- Stale remote build dependencies: `.bun-version` pins the Static Site build runtime and build commands run `bun install --frozen-lockfile` before `bun run build:*`.
- Frozen backend install failures: `backend/Dockerfile` copies all workspace manifests before `bun install --frozen-lockfile`.
- Wrong App Platform port: backend specs set both `http_port: 8080` and `PORT=8080`.
- Managed PostgreSQL TLS errors: `sslmode=require` URLs are normalized with `uselibpqcompat=true` for the Prisma PostgreSQL adapter.
- Cross-origin cookie failures: production cookies use `Secure` and `SameSite=None`; webapp requests include credentials.
- Missing monorepo files in Git: App Platform Static Sites build from the connected Git branch, not from local `dist`.
